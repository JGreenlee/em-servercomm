 * While this is the javascript implementation, it does not actually call any
 * native code! That is because it is basically a wrapper around HTTP get and
 * post, just like the corresponding native implementations are. Since the
 * javascript has perfectly good support for HTTP, we don't really need the
 * overhead of going to native. In fact, you could even argue that we don't
 * really need a wrapper here since the default implementation is easy enough
 * to use, but abstracting out the implementation makes it consistent with
 * native code, and simultaneously makes it easier for us to change the library
 * if we switch to a newer and cooler library (websockets? pub/sub? capnproto?).
